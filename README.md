# Hello there

If you're here to learn more about me feel free to look around my repositories.

I am currently migrating my active development onto
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/binkd) and therefore new projects (like
[stamail](https://codeberg.org/binkd/stamail)) will be tracked there. Existing
projects will be mirrored on a best-effort basis.

Reach me via email: [nathaniel@chappelle.dev](mailto:nathaniel@chappelle.dev)

Reach me via XMPP: [binkd@xmpp.is](xmpp:binkd@xmpp.is) (OMEMO Supported)

Reach me via [Simplex](https://simplex.chat/):
